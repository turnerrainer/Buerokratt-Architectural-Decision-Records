# Architectural Decision Records (ADR) of Bürokratt

>*The status of this document is IN PROGRESS until all major architectural decision records made so far have been covered*

This is a summary of Bürokratt's architectural decision records made over time in order to help lower the barrier of onboarding for architects, developers, business owners, etc. Content of ADR is a subject to change constantly.

* When proposing new solutions, especially to replace the ones currently in use, a decision record must be created.

* Fully processing Bürokratt's ADR before proposing and providing technical solutions for Bürokratt is a must for all of our current and future partners.

* In case of proposing a tender within any of Bürokratt's procurements, Bürokratt expects participants' technical solutions to fully comply with Bürokratt's ADR. If not, this must be clearly stated in tender. Bürokratt has the right (but not an obligation) to disregard all such tenders.
